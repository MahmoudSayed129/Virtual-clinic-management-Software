## Theme
The overarching theme of this project is to develop a comprehensive virtual clinic management software. The software will cater to the needs of patients, doctors, and clinic administrators by providing efficient tools for managing appointments, medical records, and social interactions within the healthcare community.

## Case Description
The project is inspired by common scenarios faced by patients when seeking medical treatment. These scenarios highlight the challenges patients encounter, such as finding the right doctor, scheduling appointments, accessing medical records, and managing insurance coverage. The Virtual Clinic Management Software aims to address these pain points and provide a seamless experience for patients and healthcare providers alike.

## Overview
This milestone focuses on Requirements Engineering, a critical aspect of software development. The requirements for the Virtual Clinic Management Software must be well-documented, actionable, measurable, and testable. The software modules and their corresponding main features include:

### Appointments Management System
- **Finding doctors:** Patients can search for doctors based on specialization, location, availability, and patient reviews.
- **Scheduling/Rescheduling appointments/follow-ups:** Patients can book, reschedule, or cancel appointments conveniently through the software.
- **Meeting doctors:** Patients can attend virtual or in-person appointments with their chosen healthcare providers.
- **Getting prescriptions:** Doctors can issue and manage prescriptions digitally, which patients can access and fulfill through the software.

### Users and Information Management System
- **Medical and prescription history:** Patients' medical records, including past diagnoses, treatments, and prescriptions, are securely stored and accessible to authorized healthcare providers.
- **Sensitive information sharing and access:** The software ensures the privacy and security of patients' sensitive medical information through robust access controls and encryption mechanisms.
- **Doctor and patient onboarding process:** Streamlined processes for registering new doctors and patients, including verification and authentication procedures.

### Social Management System
- **Discussion boards:** Patients and healthcare professionals can participate in online forums to discuss medical topics, share experiences, and seek advice.
- **Expert written posts:** Medical experts can publish informative articles and blog posts on healthcare-related topics to educate and inform users.
- **Doctor allocated office hours:** Doctors can set and manage their availability for appointments, indicating their office hours and preferred consultation times.
- **Doctor referrals, rankings, and ratings:** Patients can provide feedback on their experiences with healthcare providers, helping other users make informed decisions.
- **Reporting issues and handling conflicts:** Users can report any issues or conflicts encountered while using the software, with mechanisms in place to address and resolve them promptly.
